**Insurance Fraud Detection Framework: West Coast Branches Life Insurance** (March 2025) 

[View Here](https://github.com/bdcooke2/Insurance-Fraud-Detection)  

- Developed an end-to-end fraud detection framework in Python using a simulated life insurance claims dataset
- Engineered 20+ features into transactional insurance data, including rapid post-change payouts, unusual zip code overlaps, and abnormal claim-to-policy ratios
- Combined transactional screening with K-Nearest Neighbors, Local Outlier Factor, and Isolation Forest to flag anomalous claims, ensembling results to surface cases flagged by over 50% of methods
- Team identified 51% of true fraud cases—the highest in our class competition
- Built a supervised XGBoost model to rank-order the top 500 claims by fraud likelihood and financial impact
- Identified high-risk claims averaging over $620K in potential savings through optimized cost recovery
